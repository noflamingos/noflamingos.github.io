setup: |
  Create a box on the ice between the face-off dots and the goal line/top of the circle and line up five pucks outside of the box. Inside the box you can have three offensive players and two defensive players. One offensive player (or a coach) lines up with the pucks.
full_description: |
  On the whistle, all offensive players must “tag up” outside of the box and then re-enter while trying to establish their position for a screen, rebound, or back-door pass/tip. The defending players should similarly try to establish their position and box out to keep the front of the net clear. At any point after the whistle, the F outside of the box can shoot the puck. Ideally they wait and allow for a screen, an open shot, or a tip from an uncovered player.
coaching_points:
- Forwards should face the puck while keeping their sticks available for tips and rebounds.
- If uncovered, the forwards attempt to be in a position for a shot/tip.
- Defenders must box out and control the position and stick of the opponent.
- On any rebounds, defenders should box out and prevent the players from getting to the puck.
- Defenders should keep their eyes on the puck while also moving players away from the net front.
