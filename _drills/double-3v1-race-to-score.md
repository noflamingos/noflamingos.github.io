setup: |
  Split the zone in half and setup two 3v1 games. Have a coach ready with pucks on each side.
full_description: |
  Two games of three-on-one are played where the goal is to be the first group to score a goal while the defender tries to clear the puck. The rules are:
  Offensive players must stay in their third of the playing area but can move around within it.
  Offensive players must make at least three passes before taking a shot.
  Defensive player is free to move wherever they want.
  On a puck clear or goaltender freeze, the Coach will yell “new puck” and put a new puck into play (and reset the three-pass rule)
  Once a team scores, the game is over and the players should rotate.
coaching_points:
- Offensive players should use deception to open up passing lanes.
- Offensive players should look for one-timers and quick one-touch passes.
- Defenders should use active sticks to block passing lanes.
- Defenders should apply pressure but not over-commit unless they can win the battle to the loose puck.
- The coach should play a new puck in quickly to keep the pace high.
equipment:
- "Markers"
- "Nets"
- "Pucks"
categories:
- "small-area-game"
variations: |
