setup: |
  Line up F against the boards a centre ice and 2D on the blue line.
full_description: |
  The Coach plays the puck into open ice as the F swing below the blue line and skate back up the ice. One F will pick up the puck and make a quick pass. The F with the puck becomes F1 and drives wide while the other two forwards fill F2 and F3 lanes on the attack.

  The defence cannot beging skating backwards until the first forward touches the puck. The should not attack the forwards but instead should defend using their gap and angling to keep the attacking forwards to the outside. Depending on where the coach places the puck, this will give them more or less time to react.
coaching_points:
- Defence must start skating backwards (no going forwards first).
- F1 should always drive wide and either beat the D or curl and look for F3 in the slot.
