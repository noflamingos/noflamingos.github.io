setup: |
  The face-off is to be taken by a RH shot (so they are shooting on their forehand towards the boards) Two other two F line-up against the boards. The board-side D can stay back of the circle while their partner lines up on the circle just off the hashmarks. The C is trying to win the puck to the boards by slapping at the puck to create an immediate 2-on-1 in our favour. The goal is to overwhelm the opponent and gain possession regardless of a won or lost draw.
full_description: |
  The F on the hashmarks immediately ties up the opponent D to prevent them from getting to the puck while the other F attacks the puck. On a face-off loss, both players will attack the puck (likely in to the corner).

  With possession, the F has options to a) quick pass to the board-side D, a) pass down low to the other other forward, c) skate into the middle and pass to the RD, or d) continue skating into the middle for a quick shot on net.
coaching_points:
- The F on the boards must communicate with each other so they know who is tying up the opponent.
- The F who is tying up the opponent must do that immediately on puck drop (no hesitation) and the second W needs to jump to the puck.
- The board-side D should be ready for a puck won to them.
- On a face-off win, both D should be ready to move towards the middle of the ice.
- The D lining up on the face-off circle must be ready for any puck won to the middle of the ice to delay the opponent players from having an easy breakout.
