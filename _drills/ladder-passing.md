setup: |
  Line up five players staggered across the ice from each other and the remaining players on the boards with the pucks. Consider using pylons to assist until players are familiar with the drill.
full_description: |
  On the whistle the first player skates 2-3 strides with the puck and then pass to X1. They continue skating, pivot backwards to face the line, and skate backwards to the spot previously occupied by X1 as they wait for the next player in line to pass them puck. This ladder continues up the ice through each of the positions. Once X5 receives their pass, they will turn and skate up the boards around the net to get back in line.
coaching_points:
- Players must make accurate passes from a distance (rather than skating close and handing off the puck).
- After making the pass, players should quickly pivot to look back to the player who will be passing them the puck.
- Players receiving the pass must be ready and should try to receive the pass and start skating to the next pylon in one motion (i.e. not stopping and starting each time).
equipment:
- "Pucks"
- "Pylons"
categories:
- "flow"
- "passing"
variations: |
  Alternate versions can have the last player in line shoot on the goalie or wait at the far end of the ice instead of returning back to the start.
