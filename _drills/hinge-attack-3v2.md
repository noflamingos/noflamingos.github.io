setup: |
  Line up D pairs at each blue line and a F line at the red line. The C starts with the puck.
full_description: |
  On the whistle, the C passes to one of the D who will skate backwards with the puck. Their partner gets lower and waits for a pass. Both W skate past the blue line, pivot to face into the play, and the pivot again to skate up ice. The C will skate towards the blue line and will swing towards the side the pass is sent. After the D-to-D pass, the D will pass the puck to the near-side winger and then the three forwards will go 3v2 against the other D pair.
coaching_points:
- Focus D partner on getting lower than their partner to receive a pass. Focus W on their pivots to keep their body open and facing towards the play.
- If the D miss a pass or are going slower than expected, the F need to loop back so they don’t get too far ahead of the play.
- On the attack, remind forwards to attack F1, F2, F3.
