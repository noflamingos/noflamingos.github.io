setup: |
  Split players in to teams of four and align them as in the diagram. Two players from each team will be stationed in corners on the same side as the opposing goalie and cannot move beyond their corner - the other two players can move freely in the zone.
full_description: |
  On the whistle the coach will dump the puck in and the game will begin. The two players who can move freely must pass the puck to their stationary teammates on a possession change before they can attempt a shot on net. Stationary players can pass to each other, their teammates, or shoot the puck. 
coaching_points:
- Focus players on utilizing their stationary players and finding open spots to receive passes.
- Encourage stationary players to pass to each other and call out to their teammates if they’re not getting open.
