setup: |
  Players line up in a box with one puck. Consider using pylons if the group has trouble maintaining the box shape.
full_description: |
  On the whistle the players will begin moving in small circles in their area pivoting forwards to backwards and backwards to forwards as they pass the puck around. The goal is to have the playing passing the puck skating forwards while the player receiving the pass is skating backwards. The other two players should be skating in patterns so that they maintain equal distance from each other (focusing on their speed and direction and adjusting as necessary). 

  When running the drill initially, you may need to slow down the drill and have LESS movements in their pattern and then as the players get more comfortable allow them to move more and move quicker.
coaching_points:
- Maintaining their speed and direction to keep the gap between the players consistent (i.e. reading and reacting the other three players to adjust)
- Presenting their stick as a target to receive the pass.
- Making passes that lead the partner in the direction that they need to move.
- Making smooth transitions from forwards to backwards.
