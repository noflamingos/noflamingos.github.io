setup: |
  Draw lines on the ice to create two halves across the face-off dots with north-south boundaries. Coach is positioned in the slot with pucks and players are set up in four-on-two (split in half for two two-on-ones).
full_description: |
  On the whistle, the coach passes to the offensive players who are trying to score a goal while the two defenders look to block passes and clear the puck. All players must stay in their own half and offensive players should stay in roughly the same area they start. Defensive players can move anywhere in their half. The drill ends when the offensive team scores or the defensive team clears the puck (or the goalie freezes the puck). If the puck is mishandled out of play, the coach can choose to pass in a new puck or rotate in new players to restart the drill.

  The rotation alternates Xs and Os on offence and defence. The bottom two offensive players (O1s) rotate out of the drill, the two defensive players (X1/X2) rotate to become the bottom offensive players, and the top two offensive players (O2s) rotate to become the two defenders. Two new X players rotate in to become the top offensive players.
coaching_points:
- Focus players on moving the puck quickly.
- Focus defenders on active sticks and blocking lanes.
- If a player holds on to the puck for than five seconds, the play is blown dead and all players rotate.
