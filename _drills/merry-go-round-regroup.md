setup: |
  Line-up D pairs on each blue line and a F line skating around centre ice. One coach with pucks and two coaches along the boards (one on either end of the neutral zone).
full_description: |
  The drill starts when the coach passes a puck to one of the two coaches. The forwards will assume a defensive position (i.e. which ever side of centre the puck is played to will be their defensive end) and the Ws will need to recognize their side of the ice. The strong-side W and C will both attack the puck and when they gain possession will play it back to the D. The weak side will stay in the middle of the ice and once the puck battle is won will swing out wide to the boards. The D will move backwards to be able to receive the passes and will go d-to-d and then pass to the weak side W.

After winning the puck battle, the C will swing through the neutral zone, receive a quick pass from the W and attack the offensive zone as F1 (drive wide). The W that made the pass will become F3 and the W that was involved in the puck battle will be F2 (drive the net hard). The D should join the rush to be passing options however the F line should try to score off the rush.
coaching_points:
- W must react to go to their correct side.
- The weak-side W should not leave the middle of the ice until the puck battle is won.
- The weak-side W should receive the passes from the D before crossing centre ice.
- The D that will defend the rush should skate up towards centre ice before skating backwards to maintain an appropriate gap.
- After receiving the passes from the W, the C should attack the D wide.

equipment:

- "Pucks"
categories:
