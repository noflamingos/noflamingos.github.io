setup: |
  Drill is run with D pairs starting on the blue line close together. They will complete several loops before swapping out for the next pair.
full_description: |
  The Coach passes to one of the defence to start the drill who skates backwards and pivot out towards the boards as if they are making a breakout pass to a W. The other defence skates backwards going further back (below top of the circle) into the centre of the ice for support. The D with the puck turns towards the boards and makes a pass back to their partner. The second D receives the pass, skates backwards towards the far side of the ice, pivots forwards skates up ice (as if making a breakout pass to the W). The first D will skate into the slot to act as support as the second D turns towards the boards and makes a pass back to them. The loop starts again.
coaching_points:
- The support D should ensure they move to the middle of the ice and stay lower than their partner.
- After receive the pass, the D should skate backwards and quickly pivot to go forwards and move up the ice.
