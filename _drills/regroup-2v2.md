setup: |
  Setup cones down the middle of the ice. Line up two pairs of F on the red line and two pairs of D staggered to either half of the ice. Extra F and D in a tight group at centre ice along with the pucks.
full_description: |
  On the whistle, F2/F4 make a pass to the D1/D3 who then hinge and pass to their partner. Both F pairs swing across the ice and receive a pass from the D. After making their pass, the D skate up to the blue line and prepare to face a 2-on-2 from the other pair of F.
coaching_points:
- F must take the correct path/speed to ensure they receive the pass in motion going forward. If they find they have to turn to skate backwards they should instead regroup in a circle pivoting to stay facing the puck and then skate back up the ice going forward.
- The D must quickly make their passes so that the F can maintain their speed heading up ice.
- After making their passes, the D should skate up ice and then pivot backwards to minimize the gap of the other forwards on the attack.

variations: |
