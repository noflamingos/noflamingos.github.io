setup: |
  Drill is run with D pairs who complete several loops before swapping out for the next pair. X1 starts with the puck and X2 in front of the net.
full_description: |
  X1 skates up the ice, pivots backwards into the corner, pivots forwards and makes a pass behind the net to X2. As they are doing this, X2 moves from the front of the net to behind the net to support their partner and receive the pass. X2 receives the pass and completes the same pattern as X1 moves to the front of the net and then back behind the net to be a passing option for their partner.
coaching_points:
- D should time their skating so that they are in position to receive a pass without leaving the net open too early.
- Passes should be smooth and strong enough to make it to their partner.
- D should practice receive the pass on their forehand and backhand as required.
- Coaches can act as forecheckers to have the D practice reading their passing options and use escape moves before making the pass behind the net.
