setup: |
  Presuming the Ws are left- and right- shot, have them flip sides (if not, align normally). The C is trying to win the draw back towards the boards to the W.
full_description: |
  The board-side D should line-up towards the middle of the ice just off the face-off circle and their partner more to the middle of the ice than a typical line up. The goal of the face-off is to get the puck back to the D and across the net-front winger for a quick shot on net.
coaching_points:
- If the board-side W is able to make a direct pass to the net-front W they should but they should be above the top of the face-off circle to prevent the opponent from intercepting the pass.
- After making the pass, the board-side W should drive the net.
- The net-front W should get their shot off as quickly as possible.
- The middle D should move towards the middle and be a passing option for their partner in case the W is not open.
- The C should tie-up the opponent C to prevent them from blocking any cross-ice passes.
