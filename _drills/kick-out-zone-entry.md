setup: |
  Line up players in three lines at the face-off dots (in tight lines) with pucks and a group of pylons as an obstacle in the fourth corner (extended into the offensive zone). Two coaches will act as defence. Have the X1 line swap sides after a certain amount of reps.
full_description: |
  On the whistle, X1 passes to X2 who then passes to X3. After making their pass, X1 should swing through the neutral zone out wide and become F2. After X2 passes they should curl below the blue line, receive a short pass from X3, and drive through the middle of the ice acting as F1. After making their pass, X3 will act as F3 and trail the play. 

  As the players cross the line F1 (X2) will make a lateral pass to F2 (X1) and continue driving hard to the net. As F2 receives the pass they will either slow down to draw a defender towards them or drive hard wide and curl towards the boards to separate from the defender and then look for a pass into the slot for F3.
coaching_points:
- Players skating (especially F1 and F2) must adjust their speed and routes to be able to attack across the blue at the same time.
- After making their pass, F1 must drive hard to the net to draw a defence with them. 
- F3 must trail. the play to be able to receive a pass in the high slot.
- Coaches should use their position to encourage the players to execute the drill properly (e.g. if F1 doesn't drive the net then the coach should not back off.
