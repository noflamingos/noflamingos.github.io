setup: |
  Line up forwards at centre ice in two groups facing towards the nets. Defence are lined up in opposite corners at the blue line with two coaches opposite the D. Pucks are with the coaches and in the corner of the ice. The drill is run on both sides simultaneously (only half of the drill is shown).
full_description: |
  On the whistle, the D skates across the blue line, pivots, and retreats into the zone. The D will receive a pass from the coach, transition up ice and make a pass to the first F in line. The F will pass back to the coach. The D should stay in continuous motion and pivot backwards into the zone again to receive a second pass from the coach. After the F makes their pass they should curl around the neutral zone and skate straight across the blue line and receive a stretch pass from the D. They will then skate into the zone and take a shot on net. The D will follow the forward up the ice and after the F shoots they will curl into the corner, pick up a puck, pass it to the D, and drive the net for a screen/tip off the point shot.
coaching_points:
- The defence need to stay in motion throughout the drill making sure to pivot as they give and receive passes.
- The forwards should keep their eyes on the defence throughout the route so that they time it to receive the pass as the skate forwards across the blue line - they should not get to the boards or have to pivot to receive the pass (i.e. they should skate slower at the beginning and pick up speed as they skate into the pass).
- After making the pass back to the defence at the end of the drill, the forwards should drive to the net for a tip.

  An alternate version could include a 1v1 after the forward receives the stretch pass or a net-front battle after they make their pass back to the point at the end of the drill.
