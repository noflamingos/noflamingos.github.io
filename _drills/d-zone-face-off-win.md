setup: |
  Presuming D pair are left- and right-shot, have them flip sides. Both W line-up on the inside dot with the board-side winger on the inside.
full_description: |
  Immediately after the puck-drop the W skate towards the D. The C attempts to win the puck into the corner and then ties up the opponent C to delay them getting to the net. The board-side D reacts to get the puck and skates behind the net. Their partner will react to the win and become an outlet option for a d-to-d pass. The C and Ws also recognize the face-off win and the weak-side W moves towards the boards while the C covers the net front and then begins the break out.
coaching_points:
- Both W must react automatically after the puck drop as if the face-off will be lost. If the face-off is won or there is a scrum they will adjust but must not hesitate/wait before skating at the opponent D as the first reaction.
- Both D immediately engage with the opponent W to delay their progress.
- If there is a scrum/tie on the face-off, the W cutting across the ice should look for a loose puck on their way across the ice and can carry/chip the puck out of the zone or bump it back to the corner to start the breakout.
- C must tie-up the the opponent C to delay them getting to the net.
- If the opponent stacks both W in the middle of the ice, our board-side D should shift to the bottom of the circle so they are still in position to get the puck on a face-off win but are able to get to the front of the net quickly on a loss.
- On a face-off win, when the weak-side D moves to the corner, the C must cover the net front before skating up ice on the breakout.
